Since it's lauch in June 2017, the #BulliedIntoBadScience campaign has
expanded. One of the major areas that needed a serious improvements
was the website; it started as a quick page to meet the interest
following the [Academics strike back against bad
science](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/academics-strike-back-against-bad-science-t5mzcdxv8)
article, but our needs have now outgrown the first version.

So here we are, six months later, launching a our new website.
