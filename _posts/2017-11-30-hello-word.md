Since it's lauch in June 2017, the #BulliedIntoBadScience campaign has
expanded. One of the major areas that needed a serious improvements
was the website; it started as a quick page to meet the interest
following the [Academics strike back against bad
science](https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/academics-strike-back-against-bad-science-t5mzcdxv8)
article, but our needs have now outgrown the first version.

So here we are, six months later, launching a our new website. It is
certainly a good improvement, but still a work in progress. A
noteworthy addition is a new series of blog posts featuring news about
the campaign, to keep you informed about our effort. We now also have
a [German translation](letter/index_de.html) of the letter (thank you
Dieter) and hope to add additional languages in the future - don't
hesitate to get in touch if you would like to help.
