	    <h3>Implementing change</h3><a name="implement"></a>

	      <p>We submitted <b>written evidence</b> to the UK
	      Parliament Science and Technology Committee inquiry
	      on <a href="https://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/inquiries/parliament-2017/research-integrity-17-19/">Research
	      Integrity</a>. Our evidence
	      was <a href="http://data.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/committeeevidence.svc/evidencedocument/science-and-technology-committee/research-integrity/written/70592.html">published</a>
	      in October 2017. Please feel free to use/modify this
	      letter to try to implement change in your respective
	      networks.</p>
	      
	      <p>We work to <b>develop best practices</b> and we
	      provide this feedback for <b>restructuring academia</b>
	      (e.g., <a href="http://asapbio.org/peer-review">ASAPbio
	      peer review meeting</a>), for <b>research</b> (e.g.,
	      Challenges in the Scholarly Publishing Cycle
	      by <a href="https://www.researchinformation.info/">Research
	      Information Magazine</a> and for <b>assessment</b>
	      (e.g., National Environment Research Council Early
	      Career Researcher survey).</p>


	      <p>We <b>amplify</b> other early career researcher
	      voices by endorsing their efforts (e.g.,
	      the <a href="https://www.ipetitions.com/petition/bratislava-declaration-of-young-researchers">Bratislava
	      Declaration</a> folks are providing feedback for the
	      European Union Framework Programme 9 and
	      #BulliedIntoBadScience signed their position
	      statement).</p>


	      <p>We give talks to <b>increase awareness</b>
	      (e.g., <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvnHcGDI-qk">OpenCon</a>
	      (scroll to
	      1:35:49), <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncoNYM5q_Fo&feature=youtu.be&a=">OpenConCam</a>
