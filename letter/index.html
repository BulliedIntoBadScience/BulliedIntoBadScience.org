	<p>We are postdocs and a reader in the humanities and sciences
	at the University of Cambridge. <strong>We are concerned about
	the desperate need for publishing reform</strong> to increase
	transparency, reproducibility, timeliness, and academic rigour
	of the production and dissemination of scholarly outputs
	(see <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0050201">Young
	et
	al. 2016</a>, <a href="http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/3/9/160384">Smaldino
	    &amp; McElreath 2016</a>).</p>
	
	<p>We have identified actions that institutions and managers
	can take to better support ECRs (below). These actions are
	crucial for our success because we are eager to publish openly
	and at places that keep profits inside academia in accordance
	with many modern online publication venues
	(<a href="https://f1000research.com/articles/6-518/v2">Logan
	2017</a>). However, <strong>ECRs are often pressured into
	publishing against their ethics</strong> through threats that
	we would not get a job/grant unless we publish in particular
	journals
	(<a href="https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/261356">Carter
	et
	al. 2014</a>, <a href="https://svpow.com/2013/01/25/is-it-immoral-to-hide-your-research-behind-a-paywall/">Who
	is going to make change
	happen?</a>, <a href="https://sasconfidential.com/2016/02/01/scientists-publishing-system/">Kent
	2016</a>; usually these journals are older and more familiar,
	have a print version, a high impact factor, and are not 100%
	open access). These out of date practices and ideas hinder
	ECRs rather than help us: evidence shows that publishing open
	access results in increased citations, media attention, and
	job/funding opportunities
	(<a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e16800">McKiernan
	et al. 2016</a>). Open dissemination of all research outputs
	is also a fundamental principle on which ECRs rely to fight
	the ongoing reproducibility crisis in science and thus improve
	  the quality of their research.</p>
	
	<p>To support ECRs in this changing publishing landscape, we
	encourage funders, universities, departments, and politicians
	to take the following actions (below) and to announce these
	actions in public statements. We consider these actions
	essential for enabling ECRs to do and disseminate our research
	as we intend it, in an open, modern, and rigorous way. We feel
	that <strong>failure to adequately support ECRs, which are a
	vulnerable group, will prevent us from delivering outstanding
	academic outputs and becoming the academic leaders of the
	future</strong>, and thus decrease our nation’s reputation for
	world-leading research.</p>
	
	<p><strong>If you, too, have felt pressured into taking
	professional actions that are against your ethics, please mark
	which actions you agree with and join our effort to change
	academic culture.</strong> We will send letters that include
	the number of ECRs who signed each action (and their names and
	affiliations, plus some anonymised anecdotes about ECR
	experiences) to relevant institutions, focusing on UK
	politicians, universities, and funders, and to the press to
	generate publicity. Our aim is to instigate institutions into
	taking actions that are relevant to us to improve academic
	culture for ECRs. You can stay updated with the progress of
	this effort and view the letters with the actions and
	signatories
	at <a href="http://www.bulliedintobadscience.org">BulliedIntoBadScience.org</a>. The
	actions and their signatories will be available for reference
	by others who wish to create change in academic culture beyond
	the UK.</p>
	
	<h2>Action points</h2><a name="actions"></a>

	<p>We urge institutions and individuals to better support ECRs by taking these actions:</p>

	<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">

	  <li>Sign the Declaration on Research Assessment (DORA) as an
	  independent university/institution/individual (following the
	  example
	  of <a href="https://wwwf.imperial.ac.uk/utils/apps/mail/web/189214002/staff-briefing-160--our-learning-and-teaching-strategy.html">Imperial</a>
	  and <a href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/news/staff/staff-news/0115/16012015-ucl-signs-declaration-on-research-assessment">UCL</a>),
	  indicating that you will: a) “Be explicit about the criteria
	  used to reach hiring, tenure, and promotion decisions,
	  clearly highlighting, especially for early-stage
	  investigators, that the scientific content of a paper is
	  much more important than publication metrics or the identity
	  of the journal in which it was published; and b) For the
	  purposes of research assessment, consider the value and
	  impact of all research outputs (including datasets and
	  software) in addition to research publications, and consider
	  a broad range of impact measures including qualitative
	  indicators of research impact, such as influence on policy
	  and practice” (<a href="http://www.ascb.org/dora/"
	  class="uri">http://www.ascb.org/dora/</a>). These concerns
	  about access to data should not be narrowly construed as
	  concerning the ‘hard sciences’. The increasing reliance on
	  the analysis of digital information in the humanities and
	  the arts means that such issues matter across academia. As
	  digital humanities become more widespread, access to open
	  data and publications become more crucial. ECRs will benefit
	  more than other career stages from DORA being signed because
	  there
	  is <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/science-publishing-the-golden-club-1.13951">more
	  pressure to publish in journals with high impact factors
	  earlier in their career</a>.</li>
	  
	  <li>Positively value a commitment to open research and
	  publishing practices that keep profits inside academia when
	  considering candidates for positions and promotions (in
	  alignment with DORA).</li>
	  
	  <li>Endorse immediate open publishing, favouring
	  publications in journals that are 100% open access
	  (see <a href="https://doaj.org"
	  class="uri">https://doaj.org</a> for a list of high-quality
	  100% open access journals), which are more beneficial to
	  universities and researchers because: (1) they avoid being
	  overcharged by hybrid open access journals
	  (<a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/reports/apcs-and-subscriptions">Shamash
	  2016</a>, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23446/abstract">Pinfield
	  et
	  al. 2015</a>, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.2264">Solomon
	  &amp; Björk
	  2016</a>, <a href="https://unlockingresearch.blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/?p=969">Kingsley
	  2016</a>), (2) researchers retain the copyright to their
	  work
	  (<a href="http://guides.lib.umich.edu/c.php?g=283034&amp;p=1885801">University
	  of Michigan Research Guide</a>), and (3) ECRs benefit from
	  wider dissemination of their research, resulting in more
	  citations (McKiernan et al. 2016). This action helps
	  institutions implement
	  the <a href="http://guides.lib.umich.edu/c.php?g=283034&amp;p=1885801">UK
	  Concordat on Research Integrity.</li>

	  <li>Endorse posting of preprints in recognised preprint
	  servers to avoid publishing delays that are detrimental to
	  ECR career progress (<a href="http://asapbio.org"
	  class="uri">http://asapbio.org</a>; recognising that some
	  disciplines will be restricted from doing so). This is
	  particularly timely as funders, such as the MRC and the
	  Wellcome Trust, now accept preprints in grant proposals
	  (<a href="http://asapbio.org/funder-policies"
	  class="uri">http://asapbio.org/funder-policies</a>). This
	  action helps institutions implement
	  the <a href="http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Pages/research-concordat.aspx">UK
	  Concordat on Research Integrity</a>.</li>
	  
	  <li>Endorse, support and promote the open publication of
	  data and other scientific outputs such as software, which is
	  inherent to modern scientific practice and results in an
	  increase in citations for each open product
	  (<a href="https://elifesciences.org/content/5/e16800">McKiernan
	  et al. 2016</a>). This action helps institutions implement
	  the <a href="http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/documents/documents/concordatonopenresearchdata-pdf/">UK
	  Concordat on Open Research Data</a>.</li>
	  
	  <li>Educate researchers about publishing practices via
	  public statements, mandatory courses, and inductions that
	  cover: open research/data/access, mandates, hidden costs of
	  traditional publishing (e.g., publishing delays, page
	  charges and color figure charges in addition to article
	  processing charges), and how to protect ECRs against
	  exploitative publishing practices (e.g., avoiding hybrid
	  open access protects ECRs from being overcharged
	  [<a href="https://www.jisc.ac.uk/reports/apcs-and-subscriptions">Shamash
	  2016</a>, <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.23446/abstract">Pinfield
	  et
	  al. 2015</a>, <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj.2264">Solomon
	  &amp; Björk
	  2016</a>, <a href="https://unlockingresearch.blog.lib.cam.ac.uk/?p=969">Kingsley
	  2016</a>]). This action helps institutions implement
	  the <a href="https://www.vitae.ac.uk/policy/vitae-concordat-vitae-2011.pdf/@@download/file/Vitae-Concordat-Vitae-2011.pdf">UK
	  Concordat to Support the Career Development of
	  Researchers</a> and
	  the <a href="http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Pages/research-concordat.aspx">UK
	  Concordat on Research Integrity</a>.</li>
	  
	  <li>Increase transparency by reporting to the public how
	  much institutions pay for research to be published (i.e.,
	  journal subscriptions and article processing charges) to
	  raise awareness about the significant drain on public
	  funding. This will help researchers decide where to invest
	  their future publishing efforts, especially because research
	  funding is decreasing. This action helps institutions
	  implement
	  the <a href="http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Pages/research-concordat.aspx">UK
	  Concordat on Research Integrity</a>.</li>
	  
	  <li>Make all postdocs voting members of their
	  institutions. This will ensure that institutions increase
	  diversity and stay connected to the changing needs of this
	  underrepresented group that tends to be more connected to
	  modern publishing practices. Increasing the diversity of
	  career stages in decision making processes will result in
	  higher group performance, particularly where innovation is
	  concerned
	  (<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Rolf_Dick/publication/238291850_Recognizing_the_benefits_of_diversity_When_and_how_does_diversity_increase_group_performance/links/0c96053c43aecf1e81000000.pdf">Roberge
	  &amp; van Dick 2010</a>). This advances
	  two <a href="http://www.ecu.ac.uk/equality-charters/athena-swan/about-athena-swan/">Athena
	  SWAN Charter</a> points (five and nine; because, for
	  example, most female researchers at the University of
	  Cambridge are ECRs
	  [<a href="http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/cam-only/offices/planning/data/book/2016/section1.pdf">University
	  of Cambridge Databook 2016, p.26</a>]) by removing obstacles
	  faced by women at major points of career progression and by
	  mainstreaming structural and cultural changes that advance
	  gender equality. This will improve working conditions for
	  researchers, which impacts research quality, and will help
	  universities obtain or
	  retain <a href="http://www.hr.admin.cam.ac.uk/ec-hr-excellence-research-award">EC
	  HR Excellence in Research awards</a>. This action helps
